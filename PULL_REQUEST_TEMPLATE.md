**Code Review Guidelines** for Reviewers

- Try to review in a timely manner. Opinions/nitpicks should not be blockers. Pair on a call for non-trivial feedback.
- Overall design and approach should follow established patterns. Don't try to make the PR perfect.
- Try to identify edge cases, race conditions, over-engineering, lack of test coverage and complexity.
- If you don't feel qualified to review the code, pass it on to someone who is.
